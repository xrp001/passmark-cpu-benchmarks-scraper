# Passmark CPU Benchmarks Scraper
Scrape CPU benchmarks from PassMark by .txt list.

Note: The function is imperfect, very simple.


## Usage

Modify the code in ```CPU_Info-single.ipynb``` and use it to find the information of a single CPU. The searched information will be saved in ```CPU_Info-single.json```.

First specify the cpu list that needs to be searched in ```cpu_list.txt```, and then use ```CPU_Info-multiple.ipynb``` to search. The searched information will be saved in ```CPU_Info-multiple.json```.

Note that while you can do whatever you care to with this code, the data you scrape with it is for your personal use only.
